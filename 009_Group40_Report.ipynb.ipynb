    "### Summary of Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation with Heart Disease Risk Factors:\n",
    "- Age: The data suggested a strong correlation between age and heart disease, aligning with common medical understanding. Older individuals showed a higher prevalence of heart disease.\n",
    "- Resting Blood Pressure: Individuals with higher resting blood pressure were more likely to have heart disease. This finding is consistent with medical research indicating hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular conditions.\n",
    "- Cholesterol Levels: Higher cholesterol levels were associated with an increased risk of heart disease. This aligns with established knowledge about the role of cholesterol in heart health.\n",
    "- Maximum Heart Rate: An inverse relationship was observed here; lower maximum heart rates were more common in individuals with heart disease. This could reflect the decreased cardiovascular efficiency often seen in heart disease patients.\n",
    "#### Gender Differences in Heart Disease Prevalence:\n",
    "- The analysis revealed a higher incidence of heart disease in males compared to females. This finding prompts further investigation into the biological, lifestyle, and genetic factors that might contribute to this disparity.\n",
    "####  Predictive Modeling:\n",
    "The project utilized knn classification techniques to predict heart disease presence based on the identified key indicators. The effectiveness of these predictions is crucial, as it directly impacts the model's utility in clinical settings. We get out accuracy to be about `75.9%` with a precision of `74.44%` and recall of `75.2%`. We wish to increase our accuracy further along with the recall. Recall in our problem's context carries more weight than precision as it is crucial to identify all the individuals with heart diseases so that they can get treatment immediately. Misclassifying these patients could be potentially life threatening and should be consulted to a trained professional immediately. On the contrary, if a person without heart disease is classified as \"Positive\" then getting a second opinion wouldn't hurt and that patient could be showing some risk factors due to which the model predicted the patient to have heart disease. In such cases, consulting a doctor could be extremely beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, dwelling deeper into some specific risk factors from our analysis that showed more correlation (like age, sex and maximum heart rate) could help improve accuracy and provide more valuable insights into the world of heart disease  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expectations vs. Reality:\n",
    "These findings align with the initial expectations of the project as proposed. The correlation between the identified factors (resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, maximum heart rates) and heart disease was anticipated based on existing medical knowledge.\n",
    "The gender disparity in heart disease prevalence, with males being more affected than females, is something we can delve further in.\n",
    "#### Impact of the Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Medical Industry: The model, with further refinement, could significantly aid in early diagnosis and prevention of heart diseases, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.\n",
    "- Research and Medical Practice: These findings could influence future research directions and help clinicians in risk assessment and developing personalized treatment plans.\n",
    "- Public Health: Understanding these correlations can inform public health policies and educational campaigns focused on heart disease prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gender Disparity: Why are males more susceptible to heart disease than females? This could lead to investigations into biological, genetic, lifestyle, and socio-cultural factors influencing heart disease prevalence among different genders.\n",
    "2) Most Influential Factor: Among age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate, which has the most significant impact on heart disease risk? This could lead to more focused studies on individual risk factors.\n",
    "3) Improving Predictive Models: How can the accuracy of predictive models be enhanced? This includes exploring additional variables, refining data analysis techniques, and integrating machine learning advancements\n"
